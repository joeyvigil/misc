Messages from me and victoria since new york:

Since I arrive so late, I need to sleep on your couch for 1 night. Then we can get my keys the morning after.


Unless you want to go to the apartment the day before and get my key.



Um i can go tomorrow and get the key


Just gimme the details


And im not doing anything tonight.


Ok are you free all day? What would be a good time for you to pick them up?



Im pretty much free all day


But ideally sometine in the afternoon

Hey, you owe me money for a taxi ride to the airport. Apparently that shit's gonna be expensive.


11/1/19, 2:41 AM
If it will be expensive, then Ill just get a taxi to your place. I thought you might know of a cheaper way such as a bus.


I talked to the airbnb lady, she said 12 would be a good time to pick up my key.


My address is:


Address
Mariscal Antonio Jos√© de Sucre 2265, C1428DVM CABA, Argentina


the hosts number is:


+54 9 11 5407-9174


What is your address and apt number? I'll be there around 1.


I may not have wifi in chille just fyi, so this may be the last you hear from me.


Is that the only way to get around? Is there any other options?


Im in Peru right now. Being in a country where you cant communicate is  not fun. Its kindof scary tbh.


I think I might end up dead.


11/1/19, 5:09 AM

Jesus christ Joey dont be so uncultured


And look Idk what we should do. I really dont want to stay up until 1am

Ok, we can talk in text



The airport is an hour away from where I live, so it's going to be a bit pricey


Uno memento, I need to get a good connection.


Ill just take a taxi to your place. It will be half price.



Um, not really, unless you use the specific service. And I already made the reservation, it would be rude to cancel now


Look all last week you were bitching and moaning for me to pick you up.


And now, you'll probably get lost at the airport and end up using a street taxi and paying the same price as a two-way trip with the taxi service I have anyway so it doesnt really matter.


Ok, lets do it. See you soon cutie.



Kk



Hey, dont worry about dinner. Im buying some stuff right now to cook for you ‚ù§


Thanks üòòüòòüòò

Babe thanks for studying abroad, and inviting me here, this is alot of fun for me.



Thanks babe. I feel bad for not having enough time/energy to do cool stuff with you this week


De nada. Thats why im here for so long.


Does de nada make sense in that context?



Not really, but good effort lol

Hey, so my final with locals is on the 19th, so I sorta have time to study lol


Also, sorry Im so stressed this week. I guess it's finally hitting me that this semester is coming to an end. Also, after this week, I'm probably never going to see some of my exchange friends again unless they live in CO so it's a little sad



It's also making me think about how once I go home I wont see my family from here for a very long time and it really depresses me since I got so close to them and ugh, I'm just an emotional rollercoaster right now. I'm starting to wish you could have cone earlier in the semester when I was just really stoked on life and shit and not all sad that all this is coming to a close.


11/5/19, 7:20 AM
Sorry babe, we'll spend time with your family and friends while I'm here. Think of some events.


Maybe I could meet your family this weekend and we could go drinking with your friends next.



Most of my friends will be gone by friday night


Its ok, we'll figure stuff out



Also, dont let my frazzledness prevent ypu from enjoying your trip lol. Remember, I'm here to study, but you're here on vacation so have fun and live life


Regardless of whether I can or cant be there at that moment.


11/5/19, 9:31 AM


11/5/19, 4:11 PM

Hey. Can you meet me at the grocery store in 5 minutes with some money? They wont accept the $20 bills you gave me because they're slightly ripped and have a little paint on them



A Messenger user called you.
November 5, 2019 at 4:20 PM

Entertain me! Can we meet tomorrow?



Yes


Ok, what do you want to do?



Dinner?


Ok, when can we talk to your aunt and get the trip sorted out?


We're still doing that correct?



Um... tbh, I didnt think you wanted to go, so I kinda ditched that plan


Whaaat?



Look dude, you seemed really bummed about it


Can we still go?



I figured it would be better to go by myself


Tbh, I think I wanna go after I finish my classes


This makes me sad



Look, all Im gonna say is you gave me the impresion that you didnt want to go and I didnt wsnt to be around someone so negative on thst trip


The only thing I complained about was having to get my own place. I definitely still wanted to go.



You complained about having to buy another ticket.


Well its ok


We'll just have to find more stuff to do in the city



I mean, we can probably still go but it's going to be expensive as shit now


The plan would still be the same. I remember you saying "once you get here we can talk to my aunt who will help us set up the trip".



Yeah, but it would have been nice to do this past weekend


Every weekend closer tends to boost prices


I would still like to go if still possible and if its not too expensive.


But if not, we can have a plan B



Ok


Ok see you tomorrow. When do you want to meet up?



Um idk


I went out for some food when you called me about the disco. Most shops close pretty early.



Yeah


like around 7


Ok, we can head out around 4 or 5 then. Maybe have some wine beforehand, I still have that bottle.



Ok sounds like a plan


Actually wait, most restaurants dont open till 8


Well those are nice restaurants


Idk


If you want to stay out later, lets go to a nice one then.



Ok


11/6/19, 7:56 AM

Hey, so on sunday I gotta be in the San Isidrio area to meet up with a girl from my psych class and study. I figure you can tag along and we can go early so you can see the area and maybe explore a little bit


11/6/19, 9:05 AM
Ok, that sounds fun.



:)))


Well not as much for me cuz I gotta study üòÇ


üéì



Lmao



Hey I got some shit news


I dont think we can go to Iguazu together.


Apparently, theres a final project in my psych class i have to work on and I cant risk getting a shit grade


Its ok.



Let's talk more tonight. How badly do you want to see the falls? Im going to be busy, so tbh it may be a fun trip to do by yourself for a few days. You shouldnt miss an opportunity because of me.


Maybe we can talk to my aunt and see what she has to say.


Ok, we'll discuss it tonight.



If you dont want to go thats totally fine, but if you do i want to make sure you'll be able to get around without me


11/6/19, 10:53 PM
https://youtu.be/qmEdl6bOwh8


Im going to see joker alone if I cant go with you and your friends.


11/7/19, 6:47 AM

Lol aight


Tbh, we might not even see it so dont even worry


11/7/19, 9:32 AM
Well if your not seeing it with your friends, then see it with me.


Also, I think I have restless legs syndrome.


Last night my legs were aching and only stopped after I took a walk.



Ok and dude wtf


Thats sketch


Yah, maybe its from running/walking too much.


Idk it might go away.



I hope so. Make sure you're drinking enough water. Dehydration is the most common cause of cramping


Ok, that could be why


11/9/19, 7:50 AM

Hey if you wanna come over now feel free. Im still studying and will be doing so all day, but you can come hang out if ya feel like it

Hey, sorry I was being a bitch today. I think you were right that I just needed food.


Im eating dinner rn and I feel better


Its ok. I feel like ive been a burden on you this trip. Just find some time when you can hang out with me. When next week will you have time?



Well I dont have classes but I do have to study


So i guess idk


If i seem like im being needy, its only that way since your the only one I can talk to and that amount of isolation is driving me crazy.




Im sorry yo


Its ok, you're doing great. Good luck next week on your presentation.



Thanks. Im really gonna need it

Hola chicka



Sup


Do you still want to come over later for soup night round 2?



Ugh, I thought we were going out?


We can, I just have 500 pesos to spend for the rest of the trip.



Fuck.


Welp, guess everything from here is on me. How much do you have on ur sube?


Idk



Can you approximate?


Lets see, how much did we put on it originally? like 400? and I used it 10x  at 20 peso? so like 200 left?


Ok, when do you want to pregame and leave? I might be able to get money from my debit card if it is necessary



Um. Idk. Tbh, Im a bit frustrated rn


Do you even want to go out?


Only If I dont spend any money.


Are you frustrated because you need cash?



Yeah duh. And no, im frustrated because you didnt listen to my advice and now we cant really do shit the rest of the time you're here, but I guess it's whatever because you were just going to sit at home the whole time anyway so I guess it's whatever.


Like I remember telling you multiple times that you have to call the bank to use your debit card in another country. That's a task that literally takes 2 minutes to do.


I brought enough money, I just didn't know they wouldn't accept slightly damaged money. I just didn't want my card to get stolen and drained. And  I didnt want to end up spending more than the 400 I brought.



Look, next time you're going to totally ignore what I have to say, at least fucking tell me ahead of time, and dont just say "ok"



And dude, it's common fucking sense to bring more than $ 400 to another country. I know you dont think anything bad will ever happen to you, but the fact is that emergencies are possible. And if your card got stolen, you could send an email to your bank to have it cancelled. It's not that hard



Besides, you need an ID to use debit in argentina anyway, so a theif wouldnt really get far with it


Anyway, I need you to find out what time your flight leaves on monday




Ok so now we're double fucked because you dont even leave from the same airport.


So 7:02 in the morning, so I need to leave around 4.



Look, the taxi service I used to pick you up is specific to the Ezeiza international airport. You're leaving from el palomar. This means your taxi is probably going to const more.


My aunt told me not to fly from that airport because they dont have their own transportation service to get there and it's far away as fuck


Even tho their flights are cheaper, i think jet smart runs that airport, trying to get there practically makes it not worth it. But lets figure this out. Email your bank right now and see if you can get your debit card to work so we can use it to get uber working on my phone




An uber would be around this much to take you to the airport.


Hmmm, ok.


https://hangouts.google.com/



???


^^ I can make phone calls to the us



Ok


let me call my bank





sorry talking to my mom



Dont worry


made a test phone



Cool


and know im having a conversation





Ok, I called the bank, I should be able to use my card now.



Ok phew.


How about we do a practice uber to puerto madero. I'll pay of course but we'll have to use ur debit card


Cuz mine dont work


ok



Do you wanna come over? I'm still getting ready. Bring the fernet, I can make some tea


Ill stop at the supermercado and get a small chaser.


see you in 10 min.



Kk


11/15/19, 1:42 PM

11/18/19, 5:31 PM
Babe, I love you so much, thanks for showing me the city. Sorry for getting on your nerve's and getting in the way of your studying.


11/22/19, 11:18 AM
Did you take your final?



Yeah


Did it go well?



Yep


Excellent


What are you going to do this next month?


When are you going to "igozu"



Fucking explore, go to iguazu with my aunt, enjoy life


Next week


Babe, like half my trip you were angry at me, were you just stressed about your class?



Stressed about alot of things but it's whatever


Right now im eating some rice pudding.


Its very good.


Its gluten free too.



Cool bro


If you could taste it you would lose your mind, its as good as vanilla ice cream.


Its my new favorite desert. Before I would eat cookies, but now im a pudding guy.


Pudding is underrated af. Next time I go to the store im going to buy some flan.




Lol dew it


I


I've never had it, I'm a little scared.



Its better with dulce de leche

11/26/19, 1:16 PM
Can you give me your shirt size, pants size, ring size, shoe size. In case I decide to buy you a Christmas gift?



Oh shnap, it kinda varies from brand to brand. And also varies with my weight lol. Shirts are almost always size medium, pants always vary. No clue about ring size, and shoes are size 6 but with wide feet lol.


Btw, I can call now. Im back home n bouts to pack for iguazu


11/26/19, 2:48 PM
When you get back from Iguazu, can you go into a Jewelry store ask them to measure your ring size? A promise ring was one of the things I was looking at.



Um... That kinda seems like a big committment dont you think?


Maybe, not sure what the meaning behind the ring is.


But ok, Ill get you something else.



Ok



Dont worry about spending money on me, your family's big enough lol


I don't think a promise ring is that serious of a thing though. Its something that a guy would get for his girlfriend. I guess some people would argue about the message of it though.



Um. Ok


Yes, Ill probably end up spending less than 200 when everything is said and done.



Look, you've already spent enough money on me this year


Ok, its just fun buying gifts.

12/5/19, 8:20 AM
Babe, sorry ive been unemployed this last few months. I think I might have been depressed after I got those rejections durring summer time.


I feel ashamed about it, but  also feel like I have little control over it.


If you wanted to help, the best way would try and motivate me.



Joey I've tried motivating you. And it doesnt work. The only person who's going to change you is you


12/5/19, 10:18 AM
I am trying, maybe just not as hard as I could be. Motivation and encouragement always help. Im driving up to denver next week to hand out my resume in person next week. Hopefully this will work.



Im not your mother joey. You're 27 years old and need to develop a sense of personal agency and autonomy. I believe you can get a job, but I also believe it is going to take hard work, energy, and social skills that I cannot provide for you. Ultimately, the choice is yours.


Im not asking you for those things. If you don't want to help motivate me, thats your decision.



Jesus christ joey...


You really are insufferable sometimes.


No u


Which airport are you arriving at? Do you need a ride?



I got a ride




12/5/19, 1:46 PM

Hey here's your motivational speech: if you want something bad enough, you work on it and make it happen. I wanted to come to Argentina. My parents were skeptical, and when you came into the picture I had no support. It took hours of paperwork, and I wasnt even sure if it was going to happen or not, but I made it happen. Over the summer, I wanted a job. I made it happen, even if that meant moving to a bigger city for some time. When you were here, I wanted to get a good grade on my final, and even though I didnt really recieve any emotional support from you, and often felt like I had to babysit you, I made it happen. Once you left and school was done, I realized the two biggest stressers in my life were gone and I had no need for my juul. I've been nicotine free for two weeks now, because I wanted it and I made it happen. Look, if you want this job, you're going to have to put effort into it, but nobody but you can make you do that, and you shouldnt need other people holding your hand along the way. I got this far in the last few months without a fraction of support from you. If I can do it, so can you. Now get going cowboy.


Ok thanks babe ‚ù§. Sorry if you feel like I didn't support you while you were gone. üòû



I havent felt supported by you ever üòÇ


Oh, yah, even when I fixed your car?


Even when I helped you move out and pack?



I felt like you were trying to impress me


And complained about it every second?


We'll I had reason to complain about that one, but I came and helped out as much as I could nonetheless.



Lmao you STILL complain about that.


Listen, I complain very little, but that one was worth complaining about.



Christ, even my shithead ex didnt complain when he helped me move in sophomore year


Or my friend melodie when she helped me move in Junior year


You didnt have to do it if you were going to be a princess


You want me to give the reasons? keep in mind they would come off as complaining and I've already told you them.


But are you saying there is no reason to complain ever and if you do then your a princess?



I dont give a shit what you think joey.


Yah, im sure you dont.



Why should I? You dont ever listen to what I think.


Oh, yah? Name a time I've done that?



How about when I was having a panick attack and you said "cook me soup, that'll help you" and then went to the couch and watched youtube until you fell asleep


Or how about when I specifically asked you to bring emergency money to alleviate my anxiety and you completely ignored me?


I called the bank and they sorted that out very quickly, I had a lot emergency money on my card. That was my way of making sure I didn't overspend.



Oh. And you didnt call them ahead of time like I told you


But whatever


And I didn't know you were having a panic attack. Sorry babe. üòû I thought you were just board so you left. I guess I was paying too close attention to jim gaffagin.


bored*



I FUCKING SAID "I FEEL LIKE IM HAVING A PANICK ATTACK"


You obviously dont care about what I have to say, or my mental health.


I do babe


It may have been south park that was making you feel that way. I was feeling similar.


That episode made me feel anxious



Im sorry but are you retarded??


Dude, just shut up before you say another stupid thing


Maybe respond instead of calling me names?



School was making me anxious and YOU were making me anxious. I was trying to be nice so I wouldnt ruin your trip. But god Joey sometimes you say the most ignorant stuff and it makes me wonder how you ever managed to get your degree


Ok, I guess I picked a bad week to come.



It would have been a disaster regardless.


Im just glad we couldnt do Iguazu. You would not have been able to handle it


Ok, keep in mind coming was your idea.



I know. I was wrong. I'll own it.


I was wrong about alot with you


So I guess being away from me taught you alot about me?



No it made me realize what I didnt want to see


But whatever


Lets just shut up


12/5/19, 4:33 PM

Look, I'm sorry for saying such hurtful things earlier


I was bottling up my emotions and they spilled out in a very uncouth manner at my slightest annoyance


I know you didnt mean to piss me off


Its ok babe. I'd rather you tell me and feel a little better about it, than hold it in.


12/6/19, 3:43 PM

I would drink cocktails over beer any day. I don't even care if someone makes fun of me.

I think Tim might be clean now. The whole family wanted him to go to rehab, but he wanted to do it on his own, and I think he hasnt drank for the last few days. Hopefully he sticks with it, because if not we might force him to go.


You should see how big beans has gotten, hes almost full size. He still acts like a puppy though.



Wow. Hope he stays clean

You can sleep in the car if also

You didn't even reply to my last message. The one about church.

Just know Im contagious rn and still undiagnosed.


12/29/19, 2:36 PM

Anyway, good news that I should have told you this morning. Before my dad said I was too risky to be in an enclosed area around children, I was looking through my luggage to find a skirt and my veil. Anyway, somehow my wallet got wrapped up in one of my shirts.


Kinda wierd, cuz i looked through it yesterday amd couldnt find it. It must have gotten shuffled around or something


12/29/19, 3:45 PM
Cool, I'll tell my family.

Hey, so I have influenza B. Anyway, I could have been contagious anywhere from 2-4 days before I started feeling symptoms (so as early as Christmas eve), and since I hadnt gotten the vaccine this year, I'm more contagious. Let your family know that if they or their children feel any flu like symptoms, that they ought to see a doctor.


12/31/19, 11:44 AM
Are you feeling better babe? How long does the flu usually last?



7-10 days


Did you tell your family? Children are at the highest risk when it comes to the flu


I was running when I first got your message, but someone already made the announcement.


I think 5 people have it.



Ok

How much do you want to interact with me? Are you ok with me sending you messages? Do you want to go see little women with me? If you want me to just leave you alone that's ok.


JAN 9, 2020, 5:42 AM

JAN 9, 2020, 11:02 AM

I just joined this catholic "exodus 90" group.


I was the same group I was in right before I met you. The group where I gave up porn.


Also you give up a ton of other stuff.



Huh?


Wtf are you talking about


Do you remember last year right after we met, I said I just finished a group where I gave up porn, and I said I think had something to do with me finding you. at some unconscious level being without porn made me search harder for women.



Um yeah


Well I joined this same group



Gotcha


And why are you telling me this?


because I like talking to you.



Ah, gotcha


JAN 14, 2020, 11:47 AM
Can we meet tomorrow for my mock interview? And if so, when would be a good time? I wanted to do it today, but my questions and responses aren't complete.


JAN 14, 2020, 1:25 PM

Yeah we can probs meet tomorrow, idk what time tho


JAN 15, 2020, 3:49 PM
My questions and answers are taking more time than I thought, I'm not ready to interview. üò¢

Hey ur sister is right. I thought blocking you in messenger would be enough, but like she said,   it should be in private or not at all. That is why Im blocking you on facebook and other social media altogether until further notice. Because when I see something illogical, it is my nature to comment on it. I hope you know, it is because I care. If I didnt care, I'd just ignore you but I guess that's what you need right now. Best of luck, hope you figure out what ya need to do in ur life


APR 8, 2020, 1:14 AM

Shit, I thought I included this in my last msg but while im not going to lie and say im sorry for the things I said because I meant them, I am going to admit it was wrong to do it on a public platform like fb. I sincerely apologize for that. That was wrong and I should have either sent a private  message or kept my mouth shut.
