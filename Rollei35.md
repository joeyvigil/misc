In my personal opinion any 400 speed film is the best option for the Rollei 35. I simply dial in 1/250s as my default shutter speed when in daylight. Then all I need to do is to choose a suitable "sunny-16" aperture and make a very rough estimate of distance for focusing. When inside I dial in 1/60s and f/4. This works for me.
