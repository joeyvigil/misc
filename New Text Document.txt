Hello parents,

My name is Joey Teacher. I will be Hanna Teacher's replacement. I hope that I can live up to the name of both her and wonderland. Over the last two day I've been shadowing Hanna to make sure that I'm prepared to take over. I've both taught in the United States and in Jinju, so I am confident in my abilities. I look forward for this next year.

Best Wishes,
Joey Vigil
