1. Diodes
1N4148 diodes (one for each switch)

2. Switches
Many switch types available, choose based off of feel/purpose/sound

3. Keycaps
Choose based off of aesthetics, make sure the set you're buying contains enough keys

4. Stabilizers
Costar style stabilizers.

5. Micro-Controller
Two types of Micro-Controllers are common; Teensy 2.0 and Teensy++ 2.0. The Teensy 2.0 will work for keyboards with less than 80 keys. The rest will require a Teensy++ 2.0.

6. Nuts and Bolts
All keyboards require 3M x 8mm hex screws. Amount is dependent on keyboard, but will at most be 24.

7. Wire
I've had the most luck only using 20-28 awg solid core wire. I use the soldering iron to remove insulation.

8. USB Cable
Make sure it matches your Micro-Controller or you'll have to do some extra work.

9. Optional: Soldering Iron
Quality of soldering iron does not matter, they all work well in the right hands. Just make sure it's the "pencil" style of iron, and not the "gun" style. The pencil style is for soldering electronics, the gun style is for scorching designs in wood.

10. Optional: Solder
60-40 rosin core solder works best
